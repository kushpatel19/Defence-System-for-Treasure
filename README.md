# Defence-System-for-Treasure

The aim of this project is to build unique featured defence system was formed using Tinkercad softwere. Tinkercad is a free, easy-to-use app for 3D design, electronics, and coding. I have used various input methods using sensors, serial monitor, temperature and distance detector. I have learnt the C++ coding of different circuits like Servo motor, sensors, arduino on software.

Note : Before run the simulations, take a look on the code
